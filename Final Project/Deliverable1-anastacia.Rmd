## Count of Projects Launched by Year

```{r cars}
library(tidyverse)
project <- read_csv("ks-projects-201801.csv")

# Launched
library(stringr)
?str_sub
project %>% mutate(yearlaunched = str_sub(launched, start = 1, end = 4)) %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = yearlaunched)) + labs (x = 'Year', y = 'Projects Launched', title = 'Count of Projects Launched by Year' )

#There were 7 projects launched in the year 1970. We opt to exclude these outliers in our analysis, as we feel they do not adequately represent the modern kickstarter climate. 
```

## Count of Projects per Country


```{r country}
project %>% ggplot() + geom_bar(aes(x = country)) + labs (x = 'Country', y = 'Projects Launched', title = 'Count of Projects by Country' )
```
